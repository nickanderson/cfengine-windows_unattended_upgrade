#+Title: CFEngine Enterprise Unattended upgrade for windows

This policy works around bugs 3.10.0-4, and 3.12.0 that prevent the package
from upgrading successfully.

* Integration

In your masterfiles create =services/windows_unattended_upgrade= and place the
contents of this repository inside.

This policy should be included and executed by =standalone_self_upgrade.cf=.

Prepend this policy to =standalone_self_upgrade.cf=.

#+BEGIN_SRC cfenigne3
  bundle common standalone_self_upgrade_file_control
  {
    vars:
      "inputs" slist => { "$(this.promise_dirname)$(const.dirsep)services$(const.dirsep)windows_unattended_upgrade$(const.dirsep)policy$(const.dirsep)standalone_self_upgrade.cf" };
  }
  
  body file control
  {
    inputs => { @(standalone_self_upgrade_file_control.inputs) };
  }
#+END_SRC

Add a promise to run the windows_unattended_upgrade bundle between the
=methods= promises for =CFEngine Version= and =Follow up Run=.

For example:


#+BEGIN_SRC cfenigne3
      "CFEngine Version"
        usebundle => cfengine_software_version;

      "Unattended Upgrade Workaround"
        usebundle => windows_unattended_upgrade;

      "Follow up Run"
        usebundle => agent_run,
        comment => "We execute the agent after managing the software version so
                    that the next collection will see the currently running version, instead
                    of the version that was running at the beginning of the agent
                    execution.";
#+END_SRC
