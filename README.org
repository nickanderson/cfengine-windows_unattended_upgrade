#+Title: CFEngine Enterprise Unattended upgrade for windows

This policy works around bugs 3.10.0-4, and 3.12.0 that prevent the package
from upgrading successfully.

* Integration

In your masterfiles create =services/windows_unattended_upgrade= and place the
contents of this repository inside.

This policy should be included and executed by =standalone_self_upgrade.cf=.

Prepend this policy to =standalone_self_upgrade.cf=.

#+BEGIN_SRC cfenigne3
  bundle common standalone_self_upgrade_file_control
  {
    vars:
      "inputs" slist => { "$(this.promise_dirname)$(const.dirsep)services$(const.dirsep)windows_unattended_upgrade$(const.dirsep)policy$(const.dirsep)standalone_self_upgrade.cf" };
  }
  
  body file control
  {
    inputs => { @(standalone_self_upgrade_file_control.inputs) };
  }
#+END_SRC

Add a promise to run the windows_unattended_upgrade bundle after the
=methods= promise for =CFEngine Version=.

For example:


#+BEGIN_SRC cfenigne3
      "CFEngine Version"
        usebundle => cfengine_software_version;

      "Unattended Upgrade Workaround"
        usebundle => windows_unattended_upgrade;
#+END_SRC
